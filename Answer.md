   a.Hardware
   b.Software
   3.Data
   4.Storage

3. What is a Relational Database? Examples
A database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

4. Three Classifications of SQL
DDL: Defines database structures (e.g., CREATE, DROP).
DML: Manipulates data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT).
DCL: Manages access (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

5. Primary Key vs. Foreign Key
Primary Key: Uniquely identifies records in a table.
Foreign Key: Links two tables by referencing a primary key in another table.

6. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
A visual representation of entities and their relationships in a database.

7. Advantages of Relational Databases
Data Integrity: Maintains accurate and consistent data through keys and constraints.
Flexibility: Easy to modify schema and relationships.
Scalability: Can handle large volumes of data and users.
Data Security: Provides access control through permissions.
Structured Querying: Uses SQL, a standardized language for database interaction.

8. Four Data Types for Storing Data
Integer: Numbers (e.g., INT).
String: Text (e.g., VARCHAR).
Date/Time: Dates (e.g., DATE).
Boolean: True/False values.
